Dear Students,

All of you create a folder with the name of your Project and upload in Github
 - Project documentation
 - Data sets used (links from where datasets are picked)
 - Code
 - PPTs(of all the reviews)
 - a small video of your project's execution along with audio. This video should include the project aim, installations to be done, packages and a brief of different modules in your code and executions/output.
 # Note: Do not keep duplicate projects.
