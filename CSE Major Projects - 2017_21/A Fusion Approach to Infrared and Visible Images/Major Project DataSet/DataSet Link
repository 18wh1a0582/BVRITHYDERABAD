The dataset for the experiment is downloaded from the Mendeley database Powerline 
Image Dataset which contains different Infrared-IR and Visible Light-VL images and 
their labels. It contains a collection of images taken and the images were captured 
from 21 different regions all over Turkey at different seasonal days. Due to varying 
background behavior, varying temperatures and weather conditions, and varying 
lighting conditions, the achieved positive set contains several difficult scenes where 
low contrast causes close-to invisibility for power lines.
